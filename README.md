## HoroBot 0.4.0 ##
HoroBot is an IRC bot written in Node.js, meant for the management of 4chan threads.

***
### Features ###
* Automatic thread 404 checking
* A simple regex-based module system
* An easy-to-understand JSON configuration

While I do hope my IRC bot doesn't use too many resources, I have found that HoroBot seems to be using more resources with the rewrite. I, however, wish that my code be more readable and easier to commit to than less resources being used.

If you see areas where my code can improve, tell me.
